## Installation

To set up the project locally:

```bash
git clone git clone https://github.com/gdscustp/USTP-Website.git
cd USTP-Website
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Usage

Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the website locally at `http://localhost:3000/`. Any changes made to the source code will trigger a live reload of the site.

For production builds, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a production-ready version of the website in the `build` folder.

## CMS Development

The CMS provides a secure admin interface for managing content:
- Event Management: Create, update, and delete events
- Blog Posts: Rich text editor with image upload support
- User Management: Control access levels and permissions
- Dashboard: Overview of content and activities

## Scripts

- `npm start`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the production-ready version of the site.
- `npm run test`: Runs the test suite (if available).
- `npm run eject`: Ejects the project from `create-react-app` (use with caution).
